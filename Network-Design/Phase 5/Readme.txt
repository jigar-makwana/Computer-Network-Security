Execution of program in Linux lab:






		1. Make sure that all the files are in the same directory
		2. Open up 2 cmd in the same directory as your files are or just change the directory using "cd.." 
			Start the client file first by enterting in:  python2 receiver.py 1      into the first cmd prompt
			Wait for cmd to say "Listening..."
	
		
		4. Once the Client is running Open the Phase5Server.py in a seperate cmd prompt.
			This is done by typing in:  python2 server.py
			The server will now be waiting.
			
		5. Now go back to the client cmd promt and...
			Enter in the size of the window that is wanted.
			Then it will ask error % if entered an error state.
"Option 1 - no loss" 
"Option 2 - ACK packet bit-error"
