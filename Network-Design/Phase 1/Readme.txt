Files Submitted: uServer.py	Server side for the socket program
		 uClient.py	Client side for the socket program

Execution of program on Linux Ubuntu;

		1. Make sure that both files(uServer.py and uClient.py) are both on the desktop(home in ubuntu)
		2. Open up 2 terminals in the Ubuntu interface.
		3. On the first terminal Run the uServer.py
			This is done by typing in: python2 uServer.py      
			into the first terminal
			Wait for terminal to say "Server Started"
		
		4. Once server is started Input the uClient.py into the second terminal.
			This is done by typing in: python2 uClient.py
			-> will show on the screen, waiting for a lowercase input of words then an enter.

The client will contact the server, see the lowercase wording, then reply with the sentence in all caps.


*Use python2 and not python3 in terminal


Alternate use in Windows(works and sometimes doesnt)

Make sure an edition of Python 2 is installed on the windows machine.

Open up the uServer.py file and then the uClient.py file.

Type in the Client side terminal and the program will run.
