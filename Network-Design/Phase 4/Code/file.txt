1. Pick a transfer file - JPEG image file (recommended), easier to identify loss of packets in an image file (lost pixels).2. Make_packet function - parses the image file and breaks it down to several packets (set a fixed packet size, say 1024 bytes).3. Use the UDP sockets (Phase 2) to send and receive RDT2.2 packets (UDP sockets are unreliable, so they simulate the unreliable Internet IP (network) layer).4. Implement: Sequence Numbers (to identify duplicates), Checksum (implement your
own (Do not use Java/Python built-in function!), similar to UDP), and ACKs(remember, RDT 2.2 is a NAK-free protocol).5. The RDT2.2 receiver should assemble packets in order and deliver the entire transferfile to the application.
